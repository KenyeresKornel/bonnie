Jenkins and Docker are installed on the remote server so there is no need to have them on your local machine.
To be able to operate them you have to receive your accounts. Once they are created for you ->
Login to -web UI     https://bonnee.eu/ci/ 
         -CLI        ssh accountName@bonnee.eu   
         
--Jenkins--
The current Bonnie-Jenkins build is using Jenkinsfile located in the parent folder (Hexagonal).
The branch source is: "dockerize-components" from "https://github.com/tamas-csanyi-cgi/bonnie" repository.

To see all the available plugins on Jenkins from the web UI go to Dashboard>Manage Jenkins>Manage Plugins>Installed Plugins.
To create a new build, click on Dashboard>New Item, then choose a name and type of the project. Fill out the configuration and click on Apply + Save. 
Then click on Build Now, to start the building process.

--Docker--
The pipeline from Jenkinsfile contains, among other things, instructions to create docker images based on Dockerfiles located in the parent folder.
Also, there is a "docker-compose.yml" file to automatically run created containers and the message services, so there is no need to do it manually.

Basic CLI commands to operate docker images/containers manually:
docker images - show all images.
docker ps - show running images.
docker run Image - create a new container of an image, and execute the container.
docker stop Image - stop a continer.
docker start Image - launch a container previously stopped.
docker run -p portOfHost:containerPort Image - run image on specific port.
